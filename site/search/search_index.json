A less common, but incredibly useful way to interact with our computer is the command line interface. The CLI is a program that allows you to interact with your computer not through graphical elements, but rather through text-based commands . On Mac, the program used to interact with the CLI is called Terminal and on Windows it's called Command Prompt. A simple, illustrative example \u00b6 If it's helpful, you might think of a GUI as a program that issues text-based commands behind the scenes so you don't have to. In fact, several common tasks can be performed with either the GUI or CLI. For example, creating a new folder on your desktop. Creating a new folder on your desktop (Windows 10) GUI Above: creating a new folder via GUI (Windows 10) CLI Above: creating a new folder on your desktop via CLI (Windows 10) Why use the command line? \u00b6 I have a mouse and applications...why even bother with the command line?

Instead, Markdown is usually computationally converted to another format (often HTML) before it reaches its end reader, just as we might convert a word document to PDF. In fact, this web page was written in markdown before I used a static site generator called MkDocs to convert it to the HTML your browser is currently rendering. \"HTML is a publishing format, Markdown is a writing format\" -- John Gruber , Markdown co-creator As a result, the exact appearance of the resulting HTML is determined by CSS, not the Markdown itself. Comes in many flavors \u00b6 Since the release of the first iteration in 2004, many variations of Markdown have been developed for a variety of different use cases. Notable examples include Reddit-flavored Markdown and Github-flavored Markdown (GFM), each with unique conventions or additional features that are useful when writing content on Reddit and Github respectively. Tools for trying Markdown \u00b6 Markdown files are simply plain text, so you can create them in any text editor, but some editors have additional features that make writing in Markdown more enjoyable. A quick google will produce plenty of lists like this one: 4 open source Markdown editors .

Text editors are useful for people who write text-based content or code. Plain text vs. rich text \u00b6 Although we might not be able to tell when we open or write most documents, there are important differences between plain text and rich text . Word processing software such as Microsoft Word creates rich text-- text containing additional markup that specifies how the word processing software should display the text, e.g. typeface, size, paragraph spacing). Plain text, on the other hand, is just that: text characters with no hidden markup. Benefits of text editors \u00b6 There are a variety of popular text editors to choose from, many of which are free. As you look for one that suits your needs, some characteristics to look for include: Compatibility. Works on your operating system. Interface. Some are easier to work in than others. Aesthetics. The look and feel matters! Size and speed. Won't overload your computer and runs fast. Features. Integrates with other tools in your toolkit, supports code/syntax highlighting, etc. Popular text editors \u00b6 I'm currently using Visual Studio Code, but I've also used and liked Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text.
