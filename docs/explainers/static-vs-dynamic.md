# Static vs. Dynamic Websites

There are basically two types of websites: static and dynamic. 

## Static

* Site is written in plain HTML, which is interpreted by the browser and then displayed to the user.

## Dynamic

* The server still sends HTML to the browser, but first it uses a scripting language like PHP to compile the site. In other words, the site content is not necessarily written in HTML.
