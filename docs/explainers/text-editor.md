# What is a text editor?
Here, a text editor refers to a type of program that allows you to write and edit *plain text*. Text editors are useful for people who write text-based content or code.

## Plain text vs. rich text
Although we might not be able to tell when we open or write most documents, there are important differences between *plain text* and *rich text*. Word processing software such as Microsoft Word creates rich text-- text containing additional markup that specifies how the word processing software should display the text, e.g. typeface, size, paragraph spacing). 

Plain text, on the other hand, is just that: text characters with no hidden markup.

## Benefits of text editors
There are a variety of popular text editors to choose from, many of which are free. As you look for one that suits your needs, some characteristics to look for include:

* Compatibility. Works on your operating system.
* Interface. Some are easier to work in than others.
* Aesthetics. The look and feel matters!
* Size and speed. Won't overload your computer and runs fast.
* Features. Integrates with other tools in your toolkit, supports code/syntax highlighting, etc.
